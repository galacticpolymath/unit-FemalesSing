          Dot plots and histograms both show count data for a single variable. However, dot plots show how many observations (or measurements) there are for each specific value. Histograms simplify the data by "binning" points into ranges of values to make it easier to see patterns in the data.

          (I) 1-Females don't sing as often as males, which makes it easier to miss female song.
2-Female and male barn swallows look similar, making it hard to distinguish the sex of the singer.
3-Scientists have long assumed that only males sing, so they probably weren't trying to find or study female song. 
(II) I think #3 is the most important, because if scientists were looking for female song, they would have been able to find out which birds were females and when they were singing. If you're not looking for something, it is much less likely you will find it.

          Today, we began by deciphering the labels of a scatter plot. To do this we had to figure out the decipher algorithm, which we used to convert the nonsense words back into their original text. We then counted up the number of birds that sang a range of songs in order to draw a histogram.
